## Booking Workflow

1. **Customers/Receptionists select only a check-in date** when making a booking
2. **No check-out date is required or stored** in the system
3. **Room selection** is done by room type and quantity
4. **Guests check in** on their selected date
5. **Check-out is completely flexible** - guests can decide when to leave during their stay
6. **Receptionist processes check-out** when the guest is ready to leave

This system offers maximum flexibility for both guests and hotel management, allowing spontaneous extensions of stay without administrative friction.
